if you read this before INSTALL, heres a quick installation:
	./configure
	make
	su -c "make install"

HOW TO PLAY
	drag the blocks around, get the big red one opposite where it starts.
	I havent implemented winning conditions at this time, but I will soon
	enough.

	(basically the big block is R and everything else can be x)

	xxxxx
	RRxxx
	RRxxx
	xxxxx
	
	winning position:

	xxxxx
	xxxRR
	xxxRR
	xxxxx
	
FILE LOCATIONS
	The defaults for automake are _VERY_ poorly documented, so I'll mention
	them here.

	by default the following files are installed when you "make install"

	/usr/local/bin/wakkabox - the game, enjoy.

	/usr/local/etc/wakkabox/startconfig - the starting setup

	/usr/local/share/wakkabox/*.bmp - 4 bitmaps for the images.  perhaps
										the startup should be in this dir too,
										but oh well.

WINDOWS
1.  You need cygwin
2.	In order to have nice graphics, instead of clunky blocks, you will
	need to run wakkabox from a directory with the graphics files in it.
